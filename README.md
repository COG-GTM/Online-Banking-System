About

The Banking system consists of two parts: User-Front and Admin-Portal. User-Front is a user-facing system and it includes such modules as User Signup/Login, Account, Transfer, Appointment, Transaction and User Profile. Admin-Portal is mainly used by Admin and it involves User Account and Appointment modules.


Running locally

The default configuration validates the database schema against the entities and does not log SQL. To let Hibernate create or update the schema while developing, run with the `dev` profile:

    ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev

Outside development the schema is managed with migration scripts applied against the database before the application starts.
